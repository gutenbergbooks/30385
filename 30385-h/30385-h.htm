<h2><a name="iii" id="iii"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In 1888 an archaeological collection of material
from Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles in Baja California was
deposited in the United States National Museum by
Dr. Edward Palmer. Although the material was duly
catalogued, together with Dr. Palmer&#8217;s notes, it has
gone undescribed until the present.</p>

<p>Dr. Robert F. Heizer called this collection to the
attention of the senior author in 1948. At that time
the archaeology of Baja California was receiving
emphasis at the University of California because of
the interest of the Associates in Tropical Biogeography,
under the chairmanship of Dr. C. O. Sauer. The
late Professor E. W. Gifford, then Curator of the
Museum of Anthropology at the University of California,
arranged with Dr. T. Dale Stewart of the
United States National Museum for a temporary
study loan of the collection.</p>

<p>From the beginning, the division of labor between
the authors has been primarily in terms of &ldquo;hard&rdquo;
and &ldquo;soft&rdquo; artifacts. Massey has handled the analyses
of the imperishable artifacts, their ethnographic
and archaeological distributions, and the distributions
of all artifacts for Baja California. Mrs. Osborne
has dealt with the netting, textiles, and cordage,
and the distribution of their techniques outside
Baja California. Dr. Lila M. O&#8217;Neale began the analysis
of the textiles and netting and directed it until
her untimely death. Professor E. W. Gifford advised
on the initial description of the imperishable artifacts.</p>

<p>This presentation has been delayed for many
reasons, but the intervening years have added much
detailed information to the original data, both in the
literature of anthropology and in subsequent field
work.</p>

<p>We are very grateful to friends, past and present,
for their help and encouragement. We wish to acknowledge
the support of the Department of Anthropology,
University of California, for the photographs
of the imperishable materials. Thanks are due Bob
Ormsby, a University of Washington student, for the
drawings of netting. All other drawings and the maps
were done by June M. Massey. We acknowledge with
thanks the assistance of Mrs. Gene Marquez, whose
services as a typist were provided by the Department
of Biological Sciences of the University of Florida.</p>

<p>Above all we wish to dedicate this small work to
the memories of two tireless teachers and workers
in anthropology&mdash;and in humanity: Dr. Lila M. O&#8217;Neale
and Professor E. W. Gifford.</p>

<h1>A BURIAL CAVE IN BAJA CALIFORNIA</h1>

<h2>THE PALMER COLLECTION, 1887</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY</strong></p>

<p class="center"><strong>WILLIAM C. MASSEY <span class="smcap">and</span> CAROLYN M. OSBORNE</strong></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>


<p>In December of 1887 Dr. Edward Palmer, the naturalist,
set sail from the port of Guaymas in Sonora,
crossed the Gulf of California, and landed at Bah&iacute;a
de Los Angeles on the peninsula of Baja California.
Then, as now, there was a modest gold-mining operation
at the bay. During his brief stay at the mining
station, Dr. Palmer excavated a small natural cave
which had been used by the Indians who were then
extinct in that part of the peninsula.</p>

<p>Seven partially disturbed skeletons and a variety
of associated artifacts were collected and deposited
at the United States National Museum. The collection
also included some potsherds and shells from a midden
on the shores of the bay. All of these items were
listed and briefly described in the Annual Report of
the United States National Museum for the year 1888
(pp. 127-129).</p>

<p>Aside from the intrinsic value of presenting archaeological
material from the little-known area of
Baja California, the Palmer Collection has particular
importance because of its immediate geographic
source. Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles lies in that part of
Baja California most accessible to the Mexican mainland
(<a href="#map1">map 1</a>). Not only is there a relative physical
closeness, but the Gulf islands form here a series
of &ldquo;stepping stones&rdquo; from Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles
across to Tiburon Island, home of the Seri, and
thence to the adjacent mainland coast of Sonora.</p>

<p>The bay lies in the north-central desert region
of the peninsula, where the environment is especially
difficult because of extreme aridity, scarcity of
surface water, and the consequent dearth of plant
and animal life.</p>

<p>In view of these conditions, it has been suggested
that the Seri may be descendants of people who,
hard-pressed by the environmental poverty of this
section of Baja California, may have moved across
the Gulf to Tiburon Island and Sonora (Kroeber,
1931, pp. 5, 49-50). This hypothesis has appealed to
one California archaeologist, although at present
there is insufficient evidence from archaeology or
ethnography either to support or to deny it (Rogers,
1945, p. 194). However, the archaeological collection
from Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles does indicate trade and
some contact across the Gulf.</p>

<p>In this paper emphasis is placed on the evaluation
of the Palmer Collection with respect to the known
archaeology and ethnography of Baja California.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<a name="ETHNOGRAPHIC" id="ETHNOGRAPHIC"></a></p>
<p class="center"><strong>ETHNOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND</strong></p>


<p>The Indians who inhabited the area surrounding
Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles spoke the Borje&ntilde;o language of
the Peninsular Yuman group, of the Yuman Family
of languages (<a href="#map2">map 2</a>). They were linguistically and
historically related to other Yuman-speaking groups
of the peninsula and areas to the north (Massey, 1949,
p. 292). At the time of European contact these people&mdash;like
all other aboriginal groups on the peninsula&mdash;were
hunters, fishers, and gatherers. The nearest
agricultural tribes were on the lower Colorado River.</p>

<p>Culturally, the Borje&ntilde;o were like other Peninsular
Yumans of relatively late prehistoric and historic
periods in central Baja California. However, they
lived in more widely scattered groups because of the
greater scarcity of water in this part of the peninsula.
Immediately to the north of them at Bah&iacute;a de San
Luis Gonzaga&mdash;at approximately the 30th parallel&mdash;a
decided break with the Peninsular Yuman tradition
occurred.</p>

<p>In 1746, during a voyage up the gulf coast from
Loreto to the mouth of the Colorado River, Father
Fernando Consag noted that (1) the Spanish and their
&ldquo;Cochim&iacute;&rdquo; interpreters could not converse with the
natives; (2) the natives had dogs; and (3) the Indians
had pottery vessels (Venegas, 1944, III:107-109).</p>

<p>The Hungarian Jesuit was the first to note the
southeastern linguistic boundary of the California
Yuman groups, a boundary which lay immediately
north of Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles. At the same time he
placed the southernmost extent of dogs and the making
or use of pottery on the peninsula in the 18th century.</p>

<p>In describing the collection from Bah&iacute;a de Los
Angeles, we have the benefit of ethnographic descriptions
from three periods of the Spanish occupation of
Baja California prior to 1769 and the expulsion of the
Jesuit missionaries. Some historical data derive
from the initial voyages of the Spanish along the gulf
coast in the 16th century. Later there were occasional
contacts with these natives by Jesuit explorers during
the first half of the 18th century. Finally, there was
the period of active missionization, beginning with the
foundation of Santa Gertrudis (1751) and continuing
with San Borja (1762) and Santa Mar&iacute;a (1766).</p>

</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
Toward the end of the 18th century there are applicable
descriptions of Indians immediately to the north
by the Dominican priest, Father Luis Sales (1794).</p>

<p>The ethnographic information contained in the
documents bears out the fact that the cave artifacts
belong in the cultural tradition of the Borje&ntilde;o who inhabited
the region at the time of European contact
and conquest.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<a name="SITE" id="SITE"></a></p>
<p class="center"><strong>THE SITE</strong></p>


<p>Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles is a semicircular bay, about
four miles in diameter, on the gulf coast of Baja California
at 28&deg; 55' N. and 113&deg; 30' W. (<a href="#map1">map 1</a>). On the
northwest it is open to the waters of the Gulf of California
and to the Canal de las Ballenas, which runs
between the peninsula and Isla &Aacute;ngel de la Guarda,
some twelve miles distant. (This island and the
smaller Isla Smith obstruct a view of the outer gulf,
and from the shore Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles appears to
be completely landlocked.) Within a few hundred feet
of the shore, sandy beaches give way to the talus
slopes of the mesas and peaks which edge the bay.
An arroyo enters the bay from the west.</p>

<p>The cave excavated by Dr. Palmer is situated on
a granitic hill to the west of the bay, at an elevation
of 30 ft. above sea level. Just below the mouth of the
narrow fissure is a spring which supplies water to
the little mining community. The cave itself measures
9 ft. in depth; it is 6 ft. wide and 5 ft. high at the
mouth. Before Dr. Palmer&#8217;s excavations, miners of
the Gulf Gold Mining Company had removed some
stones&mdash;referred to in the Report as a &ldquo;wall&rdquo;&mdash;from
the front of the fissure, thus exposing a few bones,
which lay sun-bleached on the talus slope (Annual
Report, 1888, p. 127).</p>


<p>&nbsp;<a name="BURIALS" id="BURIALS"></a></p>
<p class="center"><strong>THE BURIALS</strong></p>


<p>The small cave at Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles contained
at least seven burials: six adults and &ldquo;fragments of
one or more infants&rdquo; (Annual Report, 1888, p. 128).
These burials were extended with an east-west orientation
corresponding to the axis of the fissure; the
foot bones were to the west, at the mouth of the cave,
and the crania were in the tapered interior. The published
report does not indicate whether placement
was prone or supine.</p>

<p>According to the Report the burials had been
placed on a layer of sewn rush matting (139533<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>; see
&ldquo;<a href="#MATTING">Matting</a>&rdquo;), of which three bundles were collected.</p>

<p>The artifacts described here were found in direct
association with the skeletons. There are few details
as to actual associations. However, three hairnets
(139534) were found on three of the crania.</p>

<p>To date, the use of small caves for the specific
purpose of burial appears to be characteristic only
of the extreme south of Baja California, in the Cape
Region. Interments there were customarily secondary,
although primary burials, usually flexed, do occur
(Massey, MS 1). In the extensive area that lies between
Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles and the Cape Region,
excavations have failed to produce cave cemeteries.
To judge from published reports, such a custom was
rare elsewhere in western North America.</p>

<p>A variety of artifacts accompanied the burials, but
while the range of types is large, the number of any
one type is small. Preservation of all specimens is
generally good. We are fortunate in having perishable
pieces&mdash;netting, matting, cloth, and wood. Certain
general categories of items, such as household utensils
and remains of foodstuffs, are absent and unreported.</p>


<p>&nbsp;<a name="ARTIFACTS" id="ARTIFACTS"></a></p>
<p class="center"><strong>ARTIFACTS</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><strong>STONE</strong></p>

<p><span class="u">Tubular stone pipes.</span>&mdash;Two tubular sandstone pipes
were recovered from the cave. They are dissimilar
in size, and, in some particulars, in manufacture.</p>

<p>The larger specimen (139563; <a href="#plate12">pl. 12</a>, <span class="u">e</span>) is a ground
sandstone tube, 29.8 cm. long. In shape it tapers very
gradually from the broad bowl end to the narrower
mouth end. The conical bowl is 3.5 cm. deep; the
mouth end has a depth of 1.6 cm. A small (4 mm.)
drilled hole connects the two ends. The mouth end is
filled by a plug of partially carbonized matted coarse
fibers. There is a narrow carbonized strip, slightly
in from the bowl end, which runs around the pipe;
this appears to be the remnant of a cord that had been
tied around it. Since the pipe had been broken at that
end, it may have been repaired aboriginally with such
a cord.</p>

<p>The smaller pipe (139564; <a href="#plate12">pl. 12</a>, <span class="u">d</span>) barely tapers
from the bowl end to the mouth end. The ends of this
pipe are conically drilled and they interconnect; there
is no drilled hole connecting the bowl with the mouth
end, as in the larger specimen. A partially carbonized
plug of matted coarse fibers also fills the mouth end
of the smaller pipe.</p>

<p>Although simple tubular stone pipes occur sporadically
in the archaeology of the Southwest, they are
encountered frequently in central and northern Baja
California. Stone tubes or pipes, called <span class="u">chacuacos</span>,
are often mentioned in Spanish sources as part of the
shaman&#8217;s paraphernalia in this Yuman-speaking area
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
of the peninsula (Venegas, 1944, I:93, 95; Clavigero,
1937, p. 115).</p>

<p>In the known areas of archaeological occurrence
these pipes appear in two distinct sizes, even as they
are represented in the two Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles
specimens. There is the long type, measuring more
than 15 cm., of which several specimens have been
found in Baja California, at Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles, at
a site near the Rosario Mission in the northwest, and
throughout the central part of the peninsula (Massey,
field notes). This type has also been noted from Ortiz,
Sonora (Di Peso, 1957, p. 288), and in a late prehistoric
or historic level at Ventana Cave (Haury, 1950, p. 331).</p>

<p>The shorter type, usually about 7 cm. in length, is
known to occur in the general central region around
Muleg&eacute; (Massey, MS 2) and at Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles.
In the Southwest, the smaller type has been reported
from Chiricahua-Amargosa II levels at Ventana Cave
(Haury, 1950, p. 329); La Candelaria Cave, Coahuila
(Aveleyra <span class="u">et</span> <span class="u">al.</span>, 1956, pp. 174-175); San Cayetano
Ruin (Di Peso, 1956, pp. 423-430); and from a series
of sites, particularly in the Mogollon area (Martin <span class="u">et</span>
<span class="u">al.</span>, 1952, pp. 112-113, fig. 44).</p>

<p>Similar pipes have also been found in the western
Great Basin at Lovelock Cave (Loud and Harrington,
1929, pl. 52) on the old shoreline of Humboldt Lake
(ibid., pl. 65), and at Humboldt Cave (Heizer and
Krieger, 1956, p. 71; pl. 31, <span class="u">e</span>, <span class="u">f</span>).</p>

<p>Ethnographically, pipes of straight tubular shape
are characteristic of California, the Great Basin, and
the west coast of Mexico; however, they are usually
of pottery where pottery-making was known (Driver
and Massey, 1957, pp. 262-263, map 70). In these
areas they were used for smoking, frequently in
association with religious or curing ceremonies.</p>

<p>In mission times tubular stone pipes were used
throughout northern and central Baja California by
shamans; they were smoked and the smoke was blown
on injured or diseased parts, or they were used as
sucking and blowing tubes for the removal of
disease-causing objects.</p>

<p><span class="u">Miscellaneous stone artifacts.</span>&mdash;There are few
stone artifacts besides the pipes. Among these is a
worked piece of pumice (139613), 8 cm. by 4 cm.,
which has a bowl-like concavity ground through from
one side to the other (<a href="#plate12">pl. 12</a>, <span class="u">c</span>). There are two
fragments of gypsum which have been roughly chipped
along one or more edges (139568, <a href="#plate13">pl. 13</a>, <span class="u">f</span>; 139569).</p>


<p>&nbsp;<a name="BONE" id="BONE"></a></p>
<p class="center"><strong>BONE</strong></p>

<p><span class="u">Bone awls or &ldquo;daggers.&rdquo;</span>&mdash;Two bone awls or &ldquo;daggers&rdquo;
of identical type are included in the collection
(139589, a and b; <a href="#plate12">pl. 12</a>, <span class="u">a</span>, <span class="u">b</span>). Both specimens
are made of the sawed and ground metapodials of some
large mammal, presumably deer. The shorter of the
two (139589a) retains vestiges of a black adhesive for
half the length of its convex surface. This is probably
the result of hafting. Nothing precisely comparable
to these specimens has been reported so far in the
archaeology of the peninsula; however, similar artifacts
do occur in near-by regions. They have been
reported from southern California (Gifford, 1940,
p. 161), from Basketmaker sites in Arizona (Kidder
and Guernsey, 1919, p. 128), and from Ventana Cave,
where they are concentrated in Level 4 (Haury, 1950,
fig. 86J, p. 376, table 30).</p>

<p>Other bone artifacts comprise two parts to flakers
(139556, 139557), for which see &ldquo;<a href="#ARTIFACTS">Wooden Artifacts</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<a name="SHELL" id="SHELL"></a></p>
<p class="center"><strong>SHELL</strong></p>

<p>A number of shell ornaments and a piece of coral
were recovered from the cave. At the same time unworked
specimens were found and collected both from
the cave and from the midden which occupies the bay
shore just east of the cave.</p>

<p><span class="u">Abalone ornaments.</span>&mdash;Three abalone shell ornaments
(139551-139553), identified as <span class="u">Haliotis splendens</span>,
were found. Two are complete, one (139553)
is fragmental. They all appear to be examples of a
single type. They are oval to circular, with the following
dimensions: 139551 (<a href="#plate13">pl. 13</a>, <span class="u">c</span>) is 4.8 cm. in
diameter; 139552 (<a href="#plate13">pl. 13</a>, <span class="u">a</span>) is 5.3 by 4.3 cm.; and
139553 (<a href="#plate13">pl. 13</a>, <span class="u">b</span>) appears to have been 3.9 cm. in
diameter. Thickness varies between 2 and 3 mm. In
manufacture the original external surface of the shell
has been ground and polished to a nacreous surface.
In decoration of the two complete specimens there is
a central conically drilled hole from which short incisions
radiate, and an additional hole is drilled on
one edge, probably for stringing. The fragmental
specimen (139553) has these holes, but in addition
has three other holes drilled near the original central
hole. The original description of the artifacts
suggests that these holes may have been intended as
repairs (Annual Report, 1888, p. 129). All three shell
specimens are edge-incised, and two have punctate
designs.</p>

<p>Until the present, few shell ornaments have been
noted in the archaeology of Baja California. No specimens
identical to those from Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles
are known; however, all of the decorative elements
and techniques recorded here can be duplicated among
specimens of oyster (<span class="u">Pinctada mazatlanica</span>) shell ornaments
from the Cape Region far to the south (Massey,
MS 1). Since abalone do not occur in the Gulf of
California, these shells must have been obtained by
the Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles people from the Pacific
Coast, either directly or in trade. Specific mention
of the use of abalone among the historic Indians of
the peninsula is rare in the documents; however,
contemporary Kiliwa women use pieces of the shell
for ornamentation (Meigs, 1939, p. 35).</p>

<p>Abalone shell was commonly used by peoples of
adjacent California. Both the shell and, probably,
the ornaments themselves were widely traded into
the Southwest. Ornaments very similar to the Bah&iacute;a
de Los Angeles specimens have been found in Basketmaker
caves in Arizona (Guernsey and Kidder, 1921, p. 49).</p>

<p><span class="u">Olivella shell.</span>&mdash;Four broken strings of <span class="u">Olivella</span>
shell beads (<span class="u">O</span>. <span class="u">biplicata</span>) (139546) were found with
the burials. Two types are represented. There are
three short strands, totaling 17 beads, in which only
the spires have been ground from the shells for stringing
(<a href="#plate13">pl. 13</a>, <span class="u">e</span>). The fourth strand held 9 <span class="u">Olivella</span> shells,
somewhat larger than the others, from which both the
spires and bases had been ground (<a href="#plate13">pl. 13</a>, <span class="u">d</span>).</p>

<p>In addition to the strings of beads, <span class="u">Olivella</span> shell
is recorded in use with two other specimens in the
collection. Fragments of shells are found as inlay on
a wooden artifact (139565); for a description see the
section on &ldquo;<a href="#ARTIFACTS">Wooden Artifacts</a>.&rdquo; They are also found
tied in with bundles of human hair in a garment
(139539).</p>

<p>The use of <span class="u">Olivella</span> shells, with spires, bases, or
both removed by grinding in order to make beads, is
known throughout Baja California archaeologically.
Similar occurrences are even more frequent in the
archaeology of southern and central California (Gifford,
1947, p. 11). <span class="u">Olivella</span> shells inlaid in asphaltum
have been found in southern California (ibid., p. 36).
The inlaid fragments of the shell from Bah&iacute;a de Los
Angeles duplicate this type of decoration.</p>

<p><span class="u">Coral.</span>&mdash;There is a piece of coral (139566) which
may have been purposefully smoothed into an elongate
object, 10.5 cm. in length.</p>

<p><span class="u">Unworked shell.</span>&mdash;Dr. Palmer collected sample
specimens of unworked shell from the open midden
on the bay to the east of the burial site, as well as
unworked shell in association with the burials in the
cave (Annual Report, 1888, p. 129). These are listed
below:</p>

<p>&nbsp;<a name="MIDDEN" id="MIDDEN"></a></p>
<p class="center"><strong>MIDDEN POTSHERDS</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the unworked shells there are body
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
and rim sherds from at least two pottery vessels
which came from a shell midden on the bay.</p>

<p>There is a single rim sherd (139614a) which
comes from a shallow bowl with a direct flat-topped
rim. Color of both the interior and exterior surfaces
is buff. The paste is fairly coarse, with a granitic
sand temper which has also some pumice inclusions.
There is also evidence of vegetable-fiber inclusions.
There is no mica in the paste. The fragment is 5 mm.
thick.</p>

<p>The second fragment (139614b) is a large rim and
body sherd from a large bowl which would have been
27 cm. in diameter and 17 cm. high. The rim is direct,
with a grooved lip (<a href="#plate18">pl. 18</a>, <span class="u">a</span>, <span class="u">b</span>). The surface
color is black to dark gray. The paste is coarse,
with sand and quartz inclusions, some of which are
as large as 5 mm. in diameter. No mica is present.
The surface is scarred by burned-away vegetable
inclusions. The specimen is about 9 mm. thick.</p>

<p>This pottery could have been native-made pottery
from the Mission period, or it could have been derived
from pottery-making Indians to the north.
Neither source has been adequately studied on the
peninsula. Comparable pieces have been seen, however,
from mission ruins in central and northern
Baja California.</p>


<p>&nbsp;<a name="WOOD" id="WOOD"></a></p>
<p class="center"><strong>WOOD</strong></p>

<p><span class="u">Flakers.</span>&mdash;Two compound flakers, made by securing
pieces of ground bone to short wooden shafts,
were found in the collection. In one specimen (139556)
the entire flaker measures 12 cm., and the projecting
bone 3.4 cm. (<a href="#plate14">pl. 14</a>, <span class="u">b</span>). The other specimen (139557)
is 13.1 cm. long, with a bone piece 5.6 cm. long (<a href="#plate14">pl. 14</a>,
<span class="u">c</span>). In both specimens the ground pieces of bone
were laid in grooves in the round wooden shafts, and
secured to them with 2-ply Z-twist cordage (see
&ldquo;<a href="#Page_346">Haftings</a>&rdquo; for details). Both of the wood shafts are
incised with lines encircling the handle area. These
lines may have been decorative, or they may have
been intended to supply friction to the grasp.</p>

<p>Flakers of bone have been reported for the northern
part of Baja California (Sales, 1794, I:49) and must
have been known to all peoples on the peninsula despite
the absence of direct evidence in the archaeology
and most of the historical sources. They were
known throughout adjacent regions, although usually
in the form of simple antler tines. Specimens identical
to those from Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles, except for
the use of sinew lashing in place of the cordage, have
been reported from Basketmaker caves in Arizona
(Guernsey and Kidder, 1921, p. 96; fig. 15c).</p>

<p><span class="u">Cane whistles.</span>&mdash;Two cane, or <span class="u">carrizo</span>, whistles
were found in the cave. They are identical in form
and mode of construction, but they differ in decorative
details. In both the whistle hole is cut into the
cane at a node, and is reinforced with a black adhesive,
possibly asphaltum.</p>

<p>Around the whistle hole of the longer of the two
specimens (139588a; <a href="#plate15">pl. 15</a>, <span class="u">h</span>) are five pits which
have been burned in; two are at one end of the hole,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
three at the other. As added decoration a series of incisions
encircles the shaft of the whistle, some of
which, at the mouth end, are joined by pairs of cut
lines. All of these incisions are blackened, either by
carbon or through handling.</p>

<p>The shorter whistle (139588b; <a href="#plate15">pl. 15</a>, <span class="u">g</span>) has no
burned pits at the hole, but the encircling incisions,
minus the connecting lines, are present. At the end
of the whistle opposite the mouth is the remnant of a
hole in which there is a fragment of knotted cordage.</p>

<p>No other whistles have been recorded for the archaeology
of the peninsula. Spanish documentary
sources are unrefined in the differentiation of flutes
and whistles; either or both were known to the historic
tribes of Baja California. Use was restricted
to ceremonial occasions in all recorded instances.</p>

<p>Directly to the north of Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles, in
the 18th century, shamans used whistles in ceremonies
performed several days after a death (Sales,
1794, I:79), just as the modern Kiliwa use a reed
flute at the <span class="u">&ntilde;iwey</span> ceremony (Meigs, 1939, p. 45). In
neighboring southern California, the use of flutes
was nearly universal, while whistles were used infrequently
(Drucker, 1937, p. 25).</p>

<p><span class="u">Bull-roarer</span> (?).&mdash;One highly polished wooden artifact
(139565) may have been used as a bull-roarer.
This artifact, with a length of 23.5 cm., a diameter
of 5.1 cm., and a thickness of 6 mm. (<a href="#plate15">pl. 15</a>, <span class="u">i</span>), is
made of a very hard dark wood&mdash;probably ironwood,
<span class="u">Olneva</span> <span class="u">tesota</span>. It is concave on both faces. At each
end, and at a right angle to the main axis of the specimen,
is a groove filled with a hardened black substance
inlaid with fragments of <span class="u">Olivella</span> shell (<span class="u">O</span>. <span class="u">biplicata</span>).
The hole at one end is biconically drilled.
This artifact has been tentatively called a &ldquo;bull-roarer&rdquo;
because no other purpose can be conjectured.
It is too large for a net-gauge, which it somewhat resembles
because of its concave ends.</p>

<p>There is no mention of bull-roarers in the Spanish
sources for the peninsula; however, one archaeological
specimen has been recovered from the surface
of a cave in the San Julio Basin, to the east of Comond&uacute;.
This wooden bull-roarer has a conventional
shape; it is a long oval-shaped piece of hardwood
which is double-convex or lenticular in cross section
and has a length of 21.5 cm.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The use of bull-roarers for ceremonial purposes
was nearly universal in southern California (Drucker,
1937, p. 25). They have also been reported for the
Kiliwa of northern Baja California, where they were
used by shamans in the <span class="u">&ntilde;iwey</span> ceremony, and for placating
ghosts by anyone in an emergency (Meigs, 1939, p. 45).</p>

<p><span class="u">Projectiles.</span>&mdash;A single compound arrow (139587)
or dart is in the Palmer Collection. Although it is
broken, there can be no doubt that the two pieces of
cane shaft form a single piece, 92.5 cm. in length
(<a href="#plate15">pl. 15</a>, <span class="u">a</span>). There is no foreshaft. The sting-ray spine,
which makes an excellent natural projectile point,
was let directly into the split end of the cane, and
was secured by cord binding (see &ldquo;<a href="#Page_346">Haftings</a>&rdquo;). Instead
of the usual nock in the butt end of the shaft
for a bowstring, there is a cuplike depression (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>).
This suggests, of course, that this may have been
a dart for use with a thrower or atlatl. Although that
weapon is unreported in the Spanish sources on central
and northern Baja California, dart-throwers
were reported by Spanish explorers for the first
quarter of the 17th century for the southern Cape
Region; they are also known archaeologically from
the same area (Massey, 1957, pp. 55-62).</p>

<p><a name="fig1" id="fig1"></a></p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 1. Detail of arrow or dart (139587), showing

</div>

<p>One smoothed wooden specimen (139560) appears
to have been a foreshaft. It is sharply pointed at one
end, and has a cuplike depression in the opposite,
thicker end. It is straight and tapered, with a length
of 38 cm. (<a href="#plate15">pl. 15</a>, <span class="u">f</span>). Similar specimens are common
in historic levels of caves in the Sierra de La Giganta
(Massey and Tuohy, MS).</p>

<p><span class="u">Viznaga spines.</span>&mdash;A bundle of seven spines of the
<span class="u">Viznaga</span> cactus (<span class="u">Echinocactus</span> <span class="u">wislizeni</span>) was found
(139547; <a href="#plate14">pl. 14</a>, <span class="u">a</span>). These spines had all been straightened
from their natural curved condition. They could
have served a variety of piercing purposes.</p>

<p><span class="u">Miscellaneous wooden artifacts.</span>&mdash;In addition to
the artifacts of vegetable origin that can be identified
with certainty, there are several fragments and whole
specimens which remain to be considered.</p>

<p>There is a round straight piece of wood (139559),
measuring 30.5 cm. in length and 8 mm. in diameter,
which has both ends blunted and rounded, apparently
from use in grinding and pounding (<a href="#plate15">pl. 15</a>, <span class="u">e</span>). Its
exact use is unknown.</p>

<p>Two sticks, lashed together in two places, were
found (139585a). Together they measure 50 cm. in
length (<a href="#plate15">pl. 15</a>, <span class="u">c</span>). The longer pointed stick has a
notched end as for an arrow butt (see &ldquo;<a href="#Page_346">Haftings</a>&rdquo; for
details of the tying).</p>

<p>There is also a round, sharply pointed, and tapered
fragment of hardwood with a length of 8.8 cm. The
shape suggests that it may have been part of a digging
stick; however, the specimen is very highly
polished on all of its preserved surfaces.</p>

<p>Two wooden fragments (139586) are listed in the
catalogue of the United States National Museum as
parts of a bow. Actually there is little about their
shape to suggest such a use (<a href="#plate15">pl. 15</a>, <span class="u">b</span>). Both are
round in cross section, and they do not fit together.
One piece (139586a), which is 58 cm. in length, is
slightly curved, with a knob carved on the complete
end. There are faint indications that there had previously
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
been wrappings at this end. The other specimen
(139586b), with a length of 56.5 cm. and a diameter
of 1.3 cm., is fragmental at both ends. It has two
places in which the shaft has been carved around. Incised
diagonal lines mark the surface in several
places.</p>


<p>&nbsp;<a name="CORDAGE" id="CORDAGE"></a></p>
<p class="center"><strong>CORDAGE AND TEXTILES</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the cordage used in the fabrication
of articles of apparel, household utensils, and for the
hafting of tools, the cave contained the usual miscellany
of prepared fibers and knots (139544) usually of
agave fiber. There is also a bundle of unspun hair
tied in the center with an overhand knot (139543). The
bulk of the miscellaneous cordage is 2-ply cord&mdash;each
single S-twisted with a final Z-twist. Since the
spinning is so uniformly of this twisting, it is highly
probable that manufacture of the cordage followed
that described by Kissell for the Papago, and noted
in many other places. This method of &ldquo;down movement&rdquo;
followed by an &ldquo;up movement&rdquo; to make the
2-ply gives a preliminary S-twist and a final Z-twist
(Kissell, 1916, p. 229).</p>

<p>Under the microscope, one of the specimens shows
a single fiber, used as a tie at a position where a new
bundle of fibers is added, weaving in and out of the
old and new bundles. This gives the fibers much
stronger binding than does twisting together alone.
The twist is normally medium-hard to hard with an
occasional cr&ecirc;pe twist.</p>

<p>Fur-wrapped cord, of which only fragments were
recovered, consists of strips of hide with fur attached,
about 1 cm. wide, wrapped around (S-twist) already
prepared 2-ply <span class="u">agave</span> fiber cord. No articles were
found which had been constructed with fur-wrapped
cord.</p>

<p>Since these fragments are undoubtedly bits broken
from finished articles or remnants from the construction
of articles, it is not surprising that, with one notable
exception, they cover the range of prepared
cordage for the other specimens. The exception is
cotton cord, of which no fragments were recovered.
This strengthens the hypothesis that the cotton cloth
(139537) was brought to the peninsula in its manufactured
state.</p>

<p>Both human-hair cord and palm-fiber cordage,
common to cave collections from the Cape Region of
southern Baja California, are missing here at Bah&iacute;a
de Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Square knots are most common in the collection
of miscellaneous cordage. This is to be expected, in
view of the square-knot construction of the hairnets
and carrying nets found in the cave.</p>

<p>Identifiable vegetal fibers include those of <span class="u">Apocynum</span>
sp. (probably <span class="u">cannabinum</span>) and <span class="u">Agave</span> sp.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>On a comparative basis the cordage and miscellaneous
knots from Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles are most like
historic-period materials from central Baja California.
Excavated sites and large private collections
there contain an overwhelming amount of cordage
that is 2-ply Z-twist; both square and overhand knots
were found. Again like Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles, nets
were made by the square-knot technique (Massey
and Tuohy, MS).</p>

<p>The southern part of the peninsula, on the contrary,
exhibits 2-ply Z-twist cordage only in slightly
over 50 per cent of collected specimens. Both knots
were known, but netting was made entirely by lark&#8217;s-head
knotting (Massey, MS 1).</p>


<p>&nbsp;<a name="CORD" id="CORD"></a></p>
<p class="center"><span class="u">Simplest Uses of Prepared Cord</span></p>

<p><span class="u">Four-warp weaving.</span>&mdash;Many samples of 4-warp
weaving were found in the miscellaneous fiber collection
(139544) and in a group of woven fragments
(139554). None was found in connection with the finished
articles of the collection, so that their use is
purely conjectural. The warp is generally 2-ply,
Z-twist, medium-&nbsp;to hard-twist cordage; the weft
is the same, but generally lighter in weight than the
warp.</p>

<p><span class="u">Cord-wrapped sticks (bobbins?).</span>&mdash;There are two
kinds of sticks wrapped with cordage: single short
sticks loosely wrapped around the midsection (bobbins?),
and pairs of sticks tied together end-to-end
tightly in two places. The cord on these specimens
is invariably of the common 2-ply Z-twist agave
fiber.</p>

<p>One of the pairs of sticks (139585a), with a total
length of 50 cm., consists of a pointed stick with a
nocked butt end lashed tightly to the second stick in
two places (<a href="#plate15">pl. 15</a>, <span class="u">c</span>). The stick with the nock appears
to be the butt end of a projectile shaft. If it were, it
would be unusual for Baja California, where projectile
shafts are usually of cane. The second specimen
(139558d) consists of two lengths of cane, 10.3 and
5.4 cm. long, which are loosely bound with a single-strand
fiber (<a href="#plate14">pl. 14</a>, <span class="u">f</span>).</p>

<p>Four specimens of sticks wrapped with cord were
recovered. Lengths of these specimens are as follows:
139558a, 22 cm. (<a href="#plate15">pl. 15</a>, <span class="u">d</span>); 139558b, 15.8 cm.
(<a href="#plate14">pl. 14</a>, <span class="u">e</span>); 139558c, 17.3 cm. (<a href="#plate14">pl. 14</a>, <span class="u">d</span>); and 139549,
11 cm.</p>

<p><span class="u">Strings for beads.</span>&mdash;Shell beads were strung on a
very fine 2-ply cord, probably made of agave fiber;
each ply consists of about three fibers, probably of
agave also (139546; <a href="#plate13">pl. 13</a>, <span class="u">d</span>). Both of these groups
are fragments, so use is again problematical.</p>

<p><span class="u">Miscellaneous.</span>&mdash;There is a piece of hide wrapped
with a 2-ply cord, probably of agave fibers, loosely
Z-twisted (139548; <a href="#plate14">pl. 14</a>, <span class="u">g</span>). The first end is secured
by wrapping-over; the outer end is drawn under some
of the cord and pulled tight.</p>

<p>Noticeably lacking from the cave materials are
sections of reed strung on cord, which formed the
aprons of women throughout most of the peninsula.
Specimens of this type are abundantly reported for
all of central and southern Baja California, and they
have been archaeologically found in the central area
(Massey, MS 1).</p>


<p>&nbsp;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>
<p class="center"><span class="u">Haftings</span></p>

<p>Five different types of hafting were found among
the Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles artifacts.</p>

<p><span class="u">Flakers (see &ldquo;<a href="#ARTIFACTS">Wooden Artifacts</a>&rdquo;).</span>&mdash;One bone flaker
(139556; <a href="#plate14">pl. 14</a>, <span class="u">b</span>) is hafted with eight rounds of cord,
of 2-ply Z-twist agave, medium-&nbsp;to hard-twist; each
single consists of three to five fibers, Z-twisted,
loose-to-medium. The original end was secured by
wrapping-over; the final end is broken and not secured
at the present time. An overhand knot with no
function occurs in the wrapping.</p>

<p>A second bone flaker (139557; <a href="#plate14">pl. 14</a>, <span class="u">c</span>) is hafted
with a 2-ply agave cord, S-twist, medium, which is
wrapped three times around the bone and wood. The
end is drawn under the three wrappings and twisted
to the original end.</p>

<p><span class="u">Darts or arrows.</span>&mdash;A third hafted specimen (139585)
consists of what appears to be broken parts of two
arrows hafted together for greater length, wrapped
in two places. The &ldquo;rear&rdquo; haftings, obviously the
main tying, consist of a cord wrapped twelve times
around the two pieces; the first end caught down by
the succeeding wrappings and the final end pulled
tight under the entire series and cut off. The same
type of cord is used for the secondary &ldquo;front&rdquo; tie,
where it is wrapped around from the middle and tied
with a granny knot.</p>

<p>The sting-ray spine point of the cane projectile
(139587) was simply inserted into the hollow cane
shaft which had been split down to a node. The cord
securing the point begins at the node on the shaft
where the cord end is caught under three wrappings,
carried up the split in the cane, wrapped three times
around the end of the cane, and broken (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). It
may once have been secured by drawing under the
final wrappings, as were most of the Bah&iacute;a de Los
Angeles haftings. The cordage used is 2 mm. in diameter
of 2-ply agave (?) with a medium-to-hard
Z-twist. Each single is S-twisted and very loose.</p>

<p><span class="u">Water bags (?).</span>&mdash;There is a cord wrapping around
what may have been the neck of a bladder or skin
water bag (139555; <a href="#plate16">pl. 16</a>, <span class="u">b</span>). The piece of skin had
been folded together very evenly by accordion-pleating
and wrapped for a length of 2 cm. with a 2-ply loosely
twisted Z-twist cord, and finally secured with a
granny knot.</p>

<p>Skins of animals and fish bladders were in use as
water containers in this area in early historic times,
as reported by Francisco Ulloa in 1540 (Wagner,
1925, pp. 25, 28). Farther south on the peninsula
similar water bags were reported in use in the 18th
century (Baegert, 1942, p. 85; W. Rogers, 1928, p. 208).</p>


<p>&nbsp;<a name="MATTING" id="MATTING"></a></p>
<p class="center"><span class="u">Matting</span></p>

<p>Two pieces of matting of distinct types were preserved
in the collection. They probably were saved
by Dr. Palmer as samples of the types in the cave.</p>

<p>One of the pieces (139544) is sewed, or threaded,
rush matting (<a href="#plate16">pl. 16</a>, <span class="u">d</span>). The lengths of rush (<span class="u">Juncus</span>
<span class="u">acutus</span> var. <span class="u">phaerocarpus</span>), which form the warp are
pierced at intervals of about 10 cm. by the sewing
thread which is a continuous length of cord, probably
of <span class="u">agave</span>. This sewing element, which serves as the
weft, consists of 2-ply Z-twist cord with a medium-to-hard
twist. Each single ply is Z-twisted in medium
degree. Total size of this well-preserved fragment
is about 50 cm. by 21 cm. The one selvage
which has been preserved would indicate that the
width of the mat at least was set when the worker
began the sewing process.</p>

<p>Apparently threaded or sewed matting was not
widely used in neighboring areas to the north. Such
matting with a decorative selvage was found by Cosgrove
in a cave in the Upper Gila region (Cosgrove,
1947, p. 114). Distributions which he gives are confined
to early Pueblo period cultures in the Southwest.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
The trait was specifically denied for Humboldt
Cave (Heizer and Krieger, 1956, p. 58).</p>

<p>The second fragment of matting (139540) consists
of bundles of unspun fibers secured by cord with a
simple overhand knot which holds the fiber warp
closely together (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>). In this tie-twined matting
the wefts are spaced at intervals of 3.2 cm., and
they consist of 2-ply <span class="u">agave</span> (?) cord with a loose to
medium Z-twist, with each single strand S-twisted.
The warp bundles, identified as grass, are not
twisted.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 2. Tie-twined matting technique.</span>
</div>

<p>Although none of the Spanish accounts lists the
use of matting by the natives of Baja California, archaeological
specimens of both the sewed and tie-twined
types have been recovered from caves in the
central region of the peninsula from Muleg&eacute; to Comond&uacute;
(Massey and Tuohy, MS; Massey, MS 2). The
tie-twined matting also occurs in the extreme south
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
of the peninsula (Massey, MS 1). Mats are recorded
as part of the household furnishings of most southern
Californians. Mats of <span class="u">Juncus</span> sp. are noted for the
Mountain and Desert Diegue&ntilde;o. The Yuma do not use
mats (Drucker, 1937, p. 21).</p>

<p>The use of tie-twined matting appears to be an old
trait in the Desert Area and its cultures. It is known
throughout the peninsula, where old traits were retained,
and also in archaeological collections from
various parts of the Great Basin and Southwest. A
sampling of the literature reveals the following occurrences:
Lovelock Cave (Loud and Harrington, 1929,
pp. 56-60); Humboldt Cave (Heizer and Krieger, 1956,
p. 57); Danger Cave (Jennings <span class="u">et</span> <span class="u">al.</span>, 1957, pp. 242-243);
Promontory Point (Steward, 1937, p. 29); Hueco
Area (Cosgrove, 1947, p. 113; see also p. 114 for
various other Southwestern locations); the Guadalupe
Mountain area (Ferdon, 1946, pp. 15-16); and portions
of Texas (Jackson, 1937, p. 157).</p>


<p>&nbsp;<a name="NETTING" id="NETTING"></a></p>
<p class="center"><span class="u">Netting</span></p>

<p><span class="u">Hairnets.</span>&mdash;Two complete hairnets (139534a and b)
and one fragment (139534c) were found on crania in
the cave (<a href="#plate16">pl. 16</a>, <span class="u">a</span>, <span class="u">c</span>). All of these were tied with a
single-element square-knot technique (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>). Cordage
is of the 2-ply Z-twist type with each single
S-twisted. The cord is probably of agave fiber.</p>

<p><a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a></p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 3. Square-knot technique.</span>
</div>

<p>The two complete hairnets are begun with a center
circle of discrete tied yarn. Ten large loops are cast
onto this. In the next round, each of the large loops
has three loops tied onto it with the continuous cord,
making a total of 30 loops for the circumference of
the net (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>). The gauge of the succeeding 15 rows
of knots is approximately 2.5 cm.</p>

<p>In order to gather the lower edge of the net for
fitting purposes, the cord was doubled and two loops
were gathered together and tied with the same square-knot
technique (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>).</p>

<p>The third net (c) has eleven loops cast onto the
original circle; the technique of tying is the same,
but the mesh gauge of 1 to 1.5 cm. is finer.</p>

<p>Among the historic tribes the wearing of hairnets,
both plain and decorated, was universal among the
women of Baja California. Such usage among southern
Californians was denied by all of Drucker&#8217;s informants
(Drucker, 1937, p. 45). There appears to be no
mention of them from the adjacent west coast of Mexico,
but they are known archaeologically from the
Great Basin. Loud and Harrington picture several
from Lovelock Cave, but give no description of the
knotting technique (1929, pl. 41). However, in their
discussion of knots they mention that the &ldquo;mesh knot&rdquo;
(weaver&#8217;s knot) was the most common, and the square
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
knot was little used (ibid., pp. 83-87). Actually the
nets, as they appear in Loud and Harrington&#8217;s plate,
are very similar to the Baja California specimens in
being knotted rather than being made by the more
frequently found coil-without-foundation technique.</p>

<p>Hairnets were also worn in ancient Peru. Some
hairnets described by Singer from Pachacamac were
constructed with square knots, but most of the 29
specimens she describes were made with the sheet-bend
(fisherman&#8217;s) knot (Singer, 1936).</p>

<p>Hairnets of the square-knot construction from Bah&iacute;a
de Los Angeles pose, at the present time, an unanswerable
question of origin and extrapeninsular distribution.</p>

<p><a name="cnet" id="cnet"></a><span class="u">Carrying net.</span>&mdash;One fragmentary net (139535a), the
original size of which cannot be determined, is similar
to the hairnets in construction, but probably was
used for carrying. The bag is tied with the same element
square knot; the mesh size is approximately
2.4 cm. Both ends of this net, however, are gathered
together. The net beginning is a small circular piece
of cord. Four loops are cast onto this; the number of
working loops is increased to 16 in the next course
by the method illustrated in <a href="#fig4">figure 4</a>. The square-knot
tying begins with the next course.</p>

<p>At the lower end, the meshes are gathered together
with a hitch (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>). This may have been put through
the loops at what would have been the top of the bag
to hold it shut. This would serve as a supplementary
tying cord rather than being part of the structure of
the net.</p>

<p>This fragmentary net has one notably unique feature.
Feathers, presumably decorative, were caught,
not in the knots themselves, but between them (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>).
The knot used is identical to the &ldquo;marline spike hitch&rdquo;
described by Graumont and Hensel (1946, p. 69;
fig. 101; pl. 29). This type of knot&mdash;more properly
called a hitch&mdash;has not been reported elsewhere
among the methods of attaching feathers. As can be
seen in the reconstruction, the feather serves to hold
the hitch, yet if the cord were to be pulled tightly
around it, the feather could be removed only with
difficulty. It remains puzzling that the carrying net,
rather than the hairnets, should be so decorated.</p>

</div>

<p>Turning to other archaeological examples of nets
from the peninsula, we learn that specimens of
square-knot netting have been found to the south in
the central region from Muleg&eacute; to Comond&uacute;. Caves
to the west of Muleg&eacute; have yielded two fragments of
square-knot netting (Massey, MS 2). Other examples
derive from Caguama and Metate caves between Comond&uacute;
and Loreto. In Metate Cave there was a single
complete carrying net (Massey and Tuohy, MS). Elsewhere
on the peninsula little is known of them except
for the southern Cape Region, where netting was in
the distinct technique of lark&#8217;s-head knotting (Massey,
MS 1).</p>

<p>On the ethnographic level, carrying nets were
widely used by Indians of western North America
from Canada to Mexico, and again in Central America.
As part of this general distribution they were
used throughout the peninsula (Driver and Massey,
1957, pp. 274, 276, map 78).</p>

<p>Among the Lower Californians nets were used for
carrying suitable gathered products, and also, in the
central part of the peninsula at least, for carrying infants.
For the latter purpose two portage methods
were in vogue: the net was suspended over the shoulders
from a tump band across the forehead; or from
the end of a pole held by one hand across the shoulder,
as a &ldquo;bindle.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&nbsp;<a name="APRON" id="APRON"></a></p>
<p class="center"><span class="u">Feathered &ldquo;Apron&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cape&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Even though this piece (139535b; <a href="#plate17">pl. 17</a>, <span class="u">a</span>) is extremely
fragmentary, it is one of the more interesting
of the perishable artifacts. At present it measures
about 25 cm. by 17.5 cm. Many of the tying cords and
feathers have disappeared or are incomplete. The
original bundles of bast fiber actually were probably
little longer than in this fragment.</p>

<p>The method of making the article has been reconstructed
as follows. The heavy &ldquo;waist belt&rdquo; cord is
a bundle of unspun fibers and spun cord, 1.5 cm. in
diameter. The origin of the spun cord is lost in the
mass of material; it is probable that the cord itself
was held by the wrapping cords from the bark units.
The hanging bundles of shredded bark were doubled
over this &ldquo;waist belt&rdquo; and wrapped with unspun fibers
to make a rigid, tightly closed bundle. These fibers
hold the feathers, which may once have covered the
bundles completely for, on some, the wrapping covers
the entire length. The length of these bundles varies
from 13 to 17.5 cm. These bundles are held in place
on the heavy cord by a wrapping cord of 2-ply
Z-twisted agave, which frequently appears to cross
the bundles and the heavy cord in a haphazard manner;
feathers are wrapped onto the heavy cord by
this means. Although now there is considerable rigidity
introduced into the fibers by dirt, the mass of
ties always prevented this from being a softly hanging
piece.</p>

<p>To date no like specimens are known from the archaeology
of the peninsula. We know of no similar
articles in historic times in Baja California, nor to
the north in southern California.</p>


<p>&nbsp;<a name="HAIR" id="HAIR"></a></p>
<p class="center"><span class="u">Human Hair &ldquo;Cape&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>The human hair &ldquo;cape&rdquo; from the Palmer Collection
(139539; also 139538, 139550) is fragmentary, but
sufficiently intact to provide complete information
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
on the technique of its construction and manufacture
(<a href="#plate17">pl. 17</a>, <span class="u">b</span>).</p>

<p>The hanks of human hair forming this garment are
from 12.7 cm. to 27.5 cm. long with the majority
falling in midrange. The hanks are about 6 mm. in
diameter. Primarily, each bundle of hanks was held
together by a light wrapping of single agave (?) fibers
and some such adhesive material as pitch. In addition,
these bundles are secondarily secured with fine 2-ply
cord, which is 1 mm. in diameter, with a hard Z-twist.
This fine cord also serves to tie each bundle to the
main cord of suspension.</p>

<p>The bundles of hair were held together by the same
tie-twining as in the matting (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>). There is an overhand
knot between each of the bundles. The twining
cord itself is 2-ply, Z-twisted in a loose twist. This
method served to fasten the bundles to the cord, space
them, and to hold them closely. This tying consists of
a basic cord and a wrapping cord. A third cord, which
formed the wrapping of the individual bundles, is carried
to the basic cord, wrapped around it, and in turn
is wrapped by the whipping cord. This wrapping is not
accomplished neatly; the garment&mdash;for all of this cord
wrapping&mdash;is not a very strongly constructed article.</p>

<p>In the Palmer Collection there are broken hanks
of human hair, undoubtedly parts of this specimen,
which are catalogued separately (139538). Among
these is a string of <span class="u">Olivella</span> beads strung on 2-ply
cord, and wrapped in with the tying cord of a hair
bundle. Thus shell beads were probably part of the
original garment. Other tied hanks of human hair
(139550) were undoubtedly parts of the specimen.</p>

<p>There is no single item of native culture of Baja
California so diagnostic or characteristic as mantles
of human hair used by shamans. Few European chroniclers
who had a chance to observe them failed to mention
this article. However, none have appeared in any
other reported archaeological excavations on the peninsula.</p>

<p>As part of the paraphernalia of the shaman, the
cape or mask of human hair was indispensable from
the Guaicura north to the Kiliwa and Western Diegue&ntilde;o.
In all recorded cases the hair was obtained from
relatives mourning the death of a recently deceased
member of the family or from the dead themselves.
Construction of the garments must have been in the
hands of the shamans themselves, so secret were
most aspects of the medicine-man&#8217;s lore.</p>

<p>Although the cultural and tribal identification of
masks or capes of human hair with the shaman is
general for the Peninsular Yumans (Cochim&iacute;), such
capes were found as far south as the Guaicura in historic
times (Baegert, 1942, p. 123). Both of the major
sources for the historic ethnography of the Yuman-speaking
peoples of central Baja California attest to
the use of this device by native medicine-men (Venegas,
1944, I:95-96, 100; Clavigero, 1937, p. 114). For
the area nearest Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles, the best description
of the use of these garments is that of the
18th-century Dominican, Father Luis Sales, who
speaks of the capes as follows (1794, pp. 76-77):</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>When all are gathered, ornamented with charcoal
and yellow, the old man places himself in the
center of the circle. Under his arm he has a
doubled mat of rushes in which he hides the rain
cape from the <span class="u">fiesta</span>.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> On another little stick he
has the hair of the dead man suspended. He indicates
silence, puts on the rain cape of the hair
of the dead, and causes as much horror as when
a bear appears. He plays a whistle and tells them
that the dead man is coming; but, however much
they look, they do not see him coming. Nevertheless
they believe it. Then he shows them the little
stick with the hair of the dead man, and tells them
that he is there, that they see him&mdash;and they see
nothing. However they give cries, they pull their
hair, and make other ridiculous actions. Finally,
relieved by crying, the old man comforts them.
He puts a thousand questions to the head of hair,
and he himself answers them to his liking.</p></div>

<p>This 18th-century description of Indians to the
north of Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles, on the Frontera, has
its exact counterpart in a 20th-century description
of the &ntilde;iwey (&ldquo;Talking with the Dead&rdquo;) Ceremony of
the Kiliwa (Meigs, 1939, pp. 50-57).</p>


<p>&nbsp;<a name="TUMP" id="TUMP"></a></p>
<p class="center"><span class="u">Tump Band</span></p>

<p>The tump band (139536) is made with the twining
technique used so frequently in such constructions.
Fragments of both ends are present, but the intervening
central portion is missing so the original
length of the specimen is not known. The largest
section is 25 cm. long and 7.7 cm. wide (<a href="#plate17">pl. 17</a>, <span class="u">d</span>).</p>

<p>The original warps were three heavy cords which
were loosely Z-twisted of two plys of 2-ply cord;
each 2-ply single is S-twisted. The fiber is probably
of some species of agave. The outer two of the three
heavy cords form the selvage cords. The center cord
was split into its two component yarns, and forms
the beginning of the inner warp threads. Two-ply
cords were introduced rapidly to make a maximum
of the 27 present at its greatest width. Introduction
of the warp elements was accomplished very evenly,
producing no distortion of the flat surface. Twining
was done with the pitch up-to-the-right. The weft
was also of 2-ply agave (?) cord.</p>

<p>The one peculiar feature of this twined band is
the form of the selvage, which gives the appearance
of a sewing running-stitch along the heavy outer
cords.</p>

<p>It is extremely unlikely that this was a sling or
belt. The band seems too rigid to have been used for
either of these two purposes, and slings are not recorded
historically from Baja California.</p>

<p>The only similar specimen know in the archaeology
of the peninsula is a fragment of a tump band from
the upper or historic level of Metate Cave near Comond&uacute;.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
This fragment is identical with the tump band
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
from Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles in weave, selvage, and
cordage. Even the count is similar: 9 warps and 15
wefts per inch for the Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles example,
and 10 by 22 for the Metate Cave specimen. Either of
these is much coarser than Basketmaker bands, like
those from Segi Canyon with their 24 warps and wefts
per inch (Guernsey, 1931, p. 9).</p>

<p>The tump band was used for portage with carrying
nets among the historic Indians of central Baja California
(see &ldquo;<a href="#cnet">Carrying Nets</a>&rdquo;). The modern Kiliwa of
the north supported nets on the back by a band which
passed across the forehead. At the forehead this band
consisted of 20 &ldquo;parallel cords&rdquo; (Meigs, 1939, p. 38;
twined or simple cords are not stipulated). Woven
packstraps were used by all southern California Indians
(Drucker, 1937, p. 21). Babies and general burdens
were carried in nets supported by the forehead
tumpline in the central and northern areas of the peninsula
(Clavigero, 1937, p. 106).</p>


<p>&nbsp;<a name="COTTON" id="COTTON"></a></p>
<p class="center"><span class="u">Cotton Cloth</span></p>

<p>Since woven cotton (<span class="u">Gossypium</span> sp.) was unknown
in aboriginal Baja California at the time of European
contact, its provenience must be beyond the peninsula.
Presumably this specimen is a piece of pre-Columbian
trade goods from the mainland of Mexico, and so belongs
in the cultural inventory of the cotton-weaving
cultures of the Oasis Area.</p>

<p>The weave of this fragment (139537) is Plain
(over-one-under-one) (<a href="#plate17">pl. 17</a>, <span class="u">c</span>). The piece, which
measures 25.5 cm. long (warp) by 30 cm. (weft), consists
of one loomstring end and neither selvage. The
warp is white cotton cord, 1 mm. in diameter, in a
loosely twisted 2-ply Z-twist. The weft of the same
material has a diameter of 2 mm. of single ply, very
loosely Z-twist cord. This weft is about the equivalent
of commercial slub with no tensile strength. The
thread count of the cloth is virtually square (6 x 5
per cm.), although the greater diameter of the tightly
beaten weft makes it the predominant feature of the
textile.</p>

<p>The warp ends carry a decorative strengthening
feature known to Southwestern textiles, both ancient
and modern. Two whipping cords that are like the
weft secure the end warp loops. They were structural
and were probably inserted while the warp was being
set up.</p>

<p>One side of the cloth has a whipped edge holding
irregularly broken weft ends. This rough mending
was accomplished with the usual native 2-ply cordage.
Depth of the stitch into the material varies considerably&mdash;an
indication of expedience rather than ornamentation.</p>

<p>Since cotton cloth and cotton are absent from the
pre-Columbian archaeology and the historic ethnography
of the peninsula, this specimen must have been
obtained through trans-Gulf trade with mainland Mexico.
The Seri of Tiburon Island and Sonora were probably
the intermediary traders. These Indians are well
aware of the peninsula opposite them to the west
(Griffen, 1959).</p>

<p>Although the weave of this specimen is the simplest
of all weaving techniques, it is lacking among
other textile materials of Baja California, such as
basketry and matting. The precise mainland derivation
of this specimen must remain in doubt; all the
tribes of Sonora&mdash;except the Seri&mdash;wove cotton (Driver
and Massey, 1957, p. 216). Plain cotton cloth was extremely
widely distributed in the prehistoric Oasis
area, and dates at least from Pueblo I times in the
American Southwest (Kent, 1957, p. 491).</p>



<p>&nbsp;<a name="SUMMARY" id="SUMMARY"></a></p>
<p class="center"><strong>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</strong></p>


<p>This small collection of archaeological materials
has a marked diversity of types, with little duplication.
Compared to similar artifacts from habitation
caves, the specimens of the Palmer Collection are
complete with the exception of the fragile garments
and the netting.</p>

<p>There are few household goods of any variety.
Most of the specimens are ornamental or have a
ceremonial significance. A number of artifacts, specifically
the tubular stone pipes, human hair cape,
cane whistles, and the probable bull-roarer, were
associated with shamans among the historic peoples
of the peninsula. It is most likely that one of the
burials was a shaman, who had been interred with
his paraphernalia in this burial cave.</p>

<p>Most of the material from Bah&iacute;a de Los Angeles
can be duplicated from various sites in the Desert
Area; however, a few have been recorded only in the
archaeology or ethnography of Baja California. These
include the human hair cape and the exclusive square-knot
netting.</p>

<p>The majority of the artifacts and traits occur in
the archaeological collections from Baja California
and are mentioned in the ethnographic accounts for
that region and for the north of the peninsula. Only
the feathered cape and the specific type of bone awl,
or &ldquo;dagger,&rdquo; are not recorded. This material bears
little resemblance to the collections or ethnographic
descriptions from the extreme south of the peninsula.</p>

<p>There is absolutely nothing in this collection and
in the affiliation of its artifacts with cultural materials
from central Baja California to support the contentions
of Malcolm Rogers (1945, p. 191 passim).
Without a doubt the Yumans of the peninsula entered
long before the advent of pottery-making in the Colorado
Desert region. Neither the Palmer Collection
nor identical materials from historic levels in the
central part of the peninsula can be explained as
being due to a post-1450 invasion of Baja California
by peoples representing the last phase of the Yuman
sequence in southern California.</p>
